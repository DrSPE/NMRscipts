# NMRscipts
Simple NMR scripts (probably not very efficient and badly commented)

Combination of python (probably python 2) and MATLAB files to imort NMR data, already prefitted Data using TopSpins T1T2 program.

Mostly useful for T1/T2/Diffusion measurments and a bit better analysis than TopSpins fitting can give.
